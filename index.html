        <p>Psychoanalysis is an open-ended talking treatment. It attends to desires, memories, feelings, and fantasies, and to the unconscious conflicts that organise them. The process aims to make unconscious patterns more thinkable, so that new ways of understanding yourself and relating to others can become possible.</p>
        <p>The work starts from the particularity of each person. We attend to your history and relationships, and to how they organise your experience in the present. Attention is paid to what is repeated, avoided, or hard to put into words, and how these patterns show themselves in the work.</p>
        <p>Sessions offer a space to speak freely about what feels stuck, overwhelming, or confusing. Over time, this can loosen fixed patterns and create room for different choices, alleviating symptoms.</p>
        <p id="about-me">If you feel caught in repeating patterns or overwhelmed by feelings that cannot yet be put into words, psychoanalysis offers a safe place to work with this.</p>

    <section class="about-me">
       <div class="title">About Me:</div> 
       <p>I studied psychology in France and completed a master's in Mental Health Studies before embarking on training as a psychoanalytic psychotherapist. I undertook the Guild's four-year programme, which covered a very broad range of psychoanalytic theory and technique. My background includes over a decade of work in mental health support services, across the NHS and the charity sector.</p>
       <p>I currently work in private practice at the Guild of Psychotherapists in Southwark, SE1 (near Southwark and Waterloo stations, and about a 15 minute walk from London Bridge). </p>
       <p>My training at the Guild of Psychotherapists has been pluralistic, drawing on a range of psychoanalytic frameworks. My practice is particularly influenced by Freudian and Lacanian theory and technique.</p>
