        <p>Psychoanalysis is an open-ended talking treatment. It attends to desires, memories, feelings, and fantasies, and to the unconscious conflicts that organise them. The process aims to make unconscious patterns more thinkable, so that new ways of understanding yourself and relating to others become possible.</p>
        <p>The work starts from the particularity of each person. We attend to your history and relationships, and to how they organise your experience in the present. Attention is paid to what is repeated, avoided, or hard to put into words, and how these dynamics show themselves in the work.</p>
        <p>Sessions offer a space to speak freely about what feels stuck, overwhelming, or confusing. Over time, this can loosen fixed patterns, creating room for different choices and relieving symptoms.</p>
        <p id="about-me">At times the work can feel challenging, particularly when long-held patterns come into focus. We take things at a pace you can bear.</p>

    <section class="about-me">
       <div class="title">About Me:</div> 
       </p>I see people for a range of difficulties and questions, including anxiety, panic attacks, depression, psychosis, obsessive or compulsive thoughts and behaviours, difficulties in relationships, or questions about sexuality or identity.</p> 
       <p>I studied psychology in France and completed a master's in Mental Health Studies before embarking on training as a psychoanalytic psychotherapist. I undertook the Guild's four-year programme, which covered a very broad range of psychoanalytic theory and technique. My background includes over a decade of work in mental health support services, across the NHS and the charity sector.</p>
       <p>I currently work in private practice at the Guild of Psychotherapists in Southwark, SE1 (near Southwark and Waterloo stations, and about a 15 minute walk from London Bridge).</p>
       <p>My training at the Guild of Psychotherapists has been pluralistic, drawing on a range of psychoanalytic frameworks. My practice is particularly influenced by Freudian and Lacanian theory and technique.</p>
