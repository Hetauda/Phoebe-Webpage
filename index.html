    <h2>Psychoanalytic Therapy & Psychoanalysis</h2>    
</header>
<main>
    <section class="description-title">
        
        <p>Psychoanalytic therapy is an open-ended talking treatment that is based on the exploration of personal desires, memories, feelings, or inner thoughts. The process aims to bring unconscious patterns and conflicts into awareness, to develop new perspectives, and to allow for different ways of relating to oneself and the world.</p>
        <p>The psychoanalytic approach prioritises the particularity of each individual, exploring how your unique experiences, relationships, and your understanding of yourself and the world influence how you experience and live your life. It is an exploration into the unconscious processes that shape your internal world, some of which you may be aware of, and others that operate beneath the surface, often exerting an influence over your feelings and behaviours.</p>
        <p>The psychoanalytic session is a space to speak to your past and present experiences, recurring patterns in your relationships, and those feelings that can sometimes feel confusing or overwhelming.</p>
        <p id="about-me">The invitation is to speak freely and to explore the roots of your experiences. If you find yourself stuck in certain patterns or struggling with distressing feelings that are difficult to put into words, psychoanalysis can offer a place to explore these safely.</p>

    <section class="about-me">
       <div class="title">About Me:</div> 
       <p>I studied a bachelor’s degree in psychology in France and then completed a master’s degree in Mental Health Studies at King’s College London. I have a decade of experience working in mental health support services, in the NHS, and in the charity sector, as well as experience working with people living with long-term health conditions. I embarked upon a UKCP-registered psychoanalytic psychotherapy training at the Guild of Psychotherapists, where I completed the four-year programme. As part of my training, I worked for two years as an honorary psychotherapist at the Guild of Psychotherapists’ Reduced-Fee Clinic.</p>
       <p>I currently work in private practice at the Guild of Psychotherapists in Southwark (near Southwark station and Waterloo).</p>
       <p>My training at the Guild of Psychotherapists embraces a pluralistic approach, exposing me to a wide range of psychoanalytic frameworks. However, my practice is particularly informed by Freudian and Lacanian theory and technique.</p>
